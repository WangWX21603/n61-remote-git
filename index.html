        <p class="answer">Earth travels around the sun in an orbit that is slightly oval-shaped, known as an ellipse. Therefore, the planet's distance from the sun changes throughout the year. However, the average distance from Earth to the sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). Scientists also call this distance one astronomical unit (AU).</p>
